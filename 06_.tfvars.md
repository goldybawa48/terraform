# .tfvars file.

**A .tfvars file in Terraform is used to set the values for variables, making it easier to manage**

- We use this file when we have large amount of variables, It is dificult to give the values of these variables in the input of the terminal.

## terraform.tfvars

- `terraform.tfvars` it is a default file of .tfvars

- Example - i have a five variables in my file like this

    ```bash
    variable "name" {
    }

    variable "age" {
    }

    variable "class" {
    }

    variable "location" {
    }

    variable "username" {
    }

    output "name1" {
      value = " ${var.name}, ${var.age}, ${var.class}, ${var.location}, ${var.username} "
    }

- if i run the command `terraform plan`, Then terraform will ask me the each 5 variables value.
- Now, I make a `terraform.tfvars ` file like this

    ```bash
    name="goldy"
    age=18
    class=13
    location="ludhiana"
    username="goldybawa48"

- Now, I run the command `terraform plan`. Now terraform will not ask me the values of these variables because i define the values in `terraform.tfvars`.

## With diffrent name file

- In a case, I want to give a variable value for testing, and after testing, I want to give values of production in variables.
- For this case i have two files of `.tfvars` first `terraform.tfvars` and second is `test.tfvars`.
- If i run `terraform plan` command then by default it `pickup terraform.tfvars` file.
- Firstly i want to test, Now i run this command to tell terraform to pickup specific file

    ```bash
    terraform plan -var-file="test.tfvars"
